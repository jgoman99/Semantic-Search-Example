Petition to put backpack hangers in every restroom stall on campus,"Sometimes the floors in restroom stalls are nasty for real and the small ones often have such little floor place that when you put your backpack down, it displaces into neighboring,  potentially nastier floors. 

Moreover, you can’t expect people to be wearing 2 layers of nice jackets coming from freezing or rainy weather whilst taking a juicy dump - we need hangers to hang them up and feel comfy. 

Sometimes – needless to say when im carrying more things than just my backpack –I opt to not use the bathrooms for #2 at all just because of the gloomy thought of having to put them on the floor. In my opinion, this is an accessibility issue. 

Sincerely, a pooper in Hearst Field Annex restrooms (decent floors, but an austerity of hangers).",1675737198,https://www.reddit.com//r/berkeley/comments/10vq0q0/petition_to_put_backpack_hangers_in_every/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley,berkeley

Hygiene Instructional Manual!,"So I figured I’d make an instructional manual on hygiene since it seems like some people aren’t sure what it entails. This post is not meant to come off rude or anything, I genuinely think it might benefit some people. This is coming from someone who had to re-learn basic hygiene after years of severe depression. I think it’s really easy for us to judge people who don’t clean themselves regularly, but the reality is that some people might not have been taught how to clean properly or they might have forgotten due to struggles with mental health. Instead of making more posts about how smelly everyone is, I think we should actively try to solve the problem by sharing hygiene tips. Here are some that I came up with. 

Ideally, you should be taking a body shower everyday. Even if you don’t wash your hair, try to wash off your body with some soap and water. If this seems like too big of a jump, start by washing your feet and your armpits on a daily basis. Apply some deodorant after cleaning. Slowly try to work up to showering on a daily basis. 

Try to wash your hair at least once a week. Focus on scrubbing your scalp instead of scrubbing your strands. The oil and dirt builds up mostly on the scalp, not the strands!

Brush your teeth twice a day, if this is daunting try starting with once a day. 

Clothes that have been worn to the gym should be washed after you finish your workout. Regular clothes that you aren’t wearing to the gym can be worn about 2-3 times if you didn’t sweat a lot. 

I hope this was helpful, and I hope we can continue to leave hygiene tips in the comments so we can educated each other and also improve the Berkeley experience for fellow bears.",1675733605,https://www.reddit.com//r/berkeley/comments/10von4b/hygiene_instructional_manual/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley,berkeley

CS70 No HW vs HW option,"Up until this point I have been acting under the assumption that I would choose the 'No HW' option for CS70, largely due to the combined workload of CS61B, Math54 and a personal project I'm working on.

However, now I'm afraid that the homework option would actually now prove useful as some sort of 'exam cushion' in case I don't do super well on exams. I would like to declare CS at the end of the semester with an A- in 61a and most likely an A in 61b, so I would technically only need a C+ (B- in the worst case scenario) to declare. Would choosing the HW option likely increase my odds of getting a better grade even though I can't guarantee I'll get full credit for it? Are there better ways to spend my limited time? Do I even have to worry about a C+/B- given that the class is graded on a curve?

Relationships while going to cal,"What are your guys’ thoughts on dating people from other schools? Sometimes I get bugged(?) (idk honestly what the feeling is) that my SO doesn’t get the workload I have here and why I can’t go out that often and have to stay up just for school. I don’t say anything because part of me thinks my thinking doesn’t make sense. Because if you’re in a long term relationship, you will probably both take turns being busier than the other (grad school while the other works 9-5, etc.) and hopefully you can just go along the ride with one another. But sometimes, I feel like it has to do with my SO’s work ethic. I’ll think along the lines of do they just not get what berkeley college life/aspirations really consist of? It makes me think that they think this is too much and that they won’t (be able to) work as hard when it’s their turn. And honestly, as someone from Cal, I want to work really hard even if it means overworking myself sometimessss. Although I am tired etc, I want to work this hard so I can get the most out of this time. Idk tho, maybe I am just being too focused on myself and not reasonably realizing someone else’s perspective. Also do realize that cal is only 4 years of life. So might be being very narrow minded, but just have felt this lowkey frustration for a while. I feel like they don’t get it (the work ethic, lifestyle, etc.). But does this also mean I’m with someone that doesn’t share the same goals/life aspirations/attitudes as me? And do we have to share those? Thoughts?",1675764246,https://www.reddit.com//r/berkeley/comments/10vy8bi/relationships_while_going_to_cal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley,berkeley

Partial IGETC and GEs,"I just discovered today that as a result of only having a partial IGETC (only missing ONE course for full certification) that I am missing a ton of GEs, to the point where I'd have to complete an additional 7 classes on top of the ones I already need to take for my major.

Does anyone know what the process is for getting previous classes recognized? Two of the big things are that now I have to fulfill the language rec for LS and that APs don't apply for GEs (of which they were accounting for 3 GE classes). Not sure how to go about resolving this, I have an advising appointment in a couple of weeks but that's not soon enough for me to pick my classes this Friday, or to know if I need to take specific ones to cross off those GE classes or if I can just continue on the track I was on.

Kinda fuming bc I'm discovering this now, on my own, after having had multiple conversations with advisors in which nothing about this was mentioned. Why is graduating and fulfilling all of the requirements so complicated? Why have they made it so difficult to figure these things out?

**RESOLVED**: For anyone who experiences the same issue, all you have to do is complete IGETC once you come to campus and then all of your GEs will be finished. Spoke with 2 counselors and I'll be able to get my IGETC certification :) Don't worry if you experience the same thing!",1675735223,https://www.reddit.com//r/UCDavis/comments/10vp9bo/partial_igetc_and_ges/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis,UCDavis

They also abused one of my other friends while they were dating, which led to them breaking up last quarter.

How to request assistance in a time of crisis while attending college (Student Emergency Tools),"Hi,

This post was inspired by a recent conversation on reddit with an UCI student who was experiencing a crisis and did not know how to ask for financial assistance and basic needs. While there are numerous resources available at UCI and elsewhere to assist students in times of need, I found that many students are unaware of their existence, and there is no all-in-one reference on the subject. As a student who had experienced the same condition, I felt obligated to share this information with my UCI sisters and brothers in order to repay the university for the great things it had done for me. These resources are free and were collected from my five years of personal experience; I have no affiliation with any of them. Other resources and supports are available beside what I share, but these are the ones that worked quickly for me in times of emergency, based on my own personal experiences.

&#x200B;

***UCI Emergency Support***

Through volunteers and staff, the Public Law Center provides free civil legal services, including **counseling**, **individual** **representation**, **community** **education**, and **strategic** **litigation** and **advocacy to challenge societal injustices.** Now in its 39th year of service, PLC works with nearly 1,500 volunteer lawyers, paralegals, law students, and others from throughout the county who volunteer their time and expertise ([link](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/flyer-for-outreach-what-plc-does-english-2020.pdf)).

&#x200B;

***Mental Health Emergency Support***

Despite the importance of **Mental Health** in college life, many students do not consider it. Students are handed over with numerous conditions that each add a distinct mental pressure. Mental health is essential because most people do not recognize their symptoms until it is too late, after they have caused numerous problems for themselves and society. The **UCI Counseling Center** ([link](https://counseling.uci.edu/)) offers 24-hour, **no-cost counseling services**. You can contact them if coursework or personal pressure that you cannot manage is affecting your mental health or judgment, and they will provide you with services such as a referral to drop the quarter. If you are diagnosed with a mental health condition, it is wise to request supporting documentation and **keep a record** of it, even if your condition is not currently interfering with your schedule, because the documentation could be useful **in the future** if you miss an exam or homework due to your condition.

**Requirements:** UCI students in all level (undergrad, grad).

&#x200B;

***Medical Emergency Support***

As long as you provide a referral document from the **UCI Student Health Center** ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/)) or any other medical facility or emergency rooms and pay the co-payment ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/docs/UC%20SHIP%20Irvine%20SBC%202021-22%204132021_0.pdf)), the majority of Medical Costs are covered by **UCSHIP**. If you need to communicate with the insurance department or nurses, you can use the **health center's portal**, which is the most secure method, and they typically respond the same day.

**Requirements:** Undergraduate and graduate UCI students who signed up for UCSHIP medical insurance.

&#x200B;

***Affordable Medical Emergency Support***

If you do not have **UCSHIP**, **SOS** ([link](https://www.shareourselves.org/)) provides low-cost medical services and accepts **Medical**. To schedule a meeting with your assigned case manager, you must **contact their phone number**. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* Coverage Programs
* Medical Services
* Dental Services
* Women’s Health
* OB Program
* Children’s Services
* Behavioral Health
* Pharmacy Services
* Health Education

**Requirements:** everyone with a medical issue qualifies.

&#x200B;

In the event of a **dental emergency**, school insurance will cover a portion of the costs ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/docs/131943A_EOC_UCSHIP_v3_remediated_Final.pdf)), but you must schedule an appointment at the UCI Dental Clinic ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/services/dental-services)), where they will refer you to a dentist or oral surgeon following an examination. If you do not have sufficient funds, you can request that the provider apply for **Care Credit**, a program that checks your credit and lends you money for dental repair.

**Requirements:** Undergraduate and graduate UCI students who signed up for Delta dental insurance..

&#x200B;

***Free Dental Emergency***

The Omid Institute ([link](https://www.omidinstitute.org/)) offers Dental Services for free or at a low cost. You must complete a form on their website and schedule a meeting with your case manager. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

**Requirements:** UCI students in all level (undergrad, grad).

&#x200B;

***Coursework Emergency***

To raise your concern about **grades and courses** you need to contact your **department**. Contrary to popular belief, **email communication with administration or professors is typically ignored** for many reasons especially after the quarter has ended. Schedule a **remote meeting** with the department, and they will assign you an **advocate (advisor)** to follow up on your concern and negotiate with the professors. The same rule applies to the dean, in which all academic advisors report daily to the dean and seek assistance from the dean when they are unable to resolve issues with professors. For the same reason, the dean is not directly concerned with student matters.

&#x200B;

***Academic Probation Support***

The best way to get off **academic probation** is to schedule an appointment with a department advisor and then **enroll in easy general courses** for the following quarter. It may alter the plan you had in mind, but it prevents you from being disqualified, as academic probation is **removed** if the requirements are met the following quarter.

&#x200B;

***Communication Emergency***

If you cannot afford a **phone or the monthly fee**, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) provides eligible individuals with a free phone line and mobile device (Lifeline). If you are currently receiving **CalFresh**, which indicates a low income condition, you have met the requirements. The line and device are free for one year, and will be renewed annually if the requirements are met. To receive the line and device, you must submit an application to a phone carrier. The **Assurance Wireless** ([link](https://www.assurancewireless.com/)) is one of the providers for which you can submit an online application on their website; if approved, you will receive a phone device within two weeks. You are not eligible for a second phone for one year, as each line is associated with a single individual and includes **6 GB of internet and unlimited calls and texts monthly**.

**Requirements:** Receiving CalFresh.

&#x200B;

***Unauthorized Transaction and Identity Theft Emergency***

If you discover an **unauthorized charge** on your bank account or an **unauthorized credit inquiry**, you must notify the **state police** and retain a copy of the **police report**. Then you must contact your bank and dispute the transaction. In the event of an unauthorized credit pull, you must send a letter along with a police report to the **credit bureaus** (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) requesting that they remove the inquiry. Each year, you can monitor your credit for free on AnnualCreditReport ([link](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action)).

&#x200B;

***Computer Emergency***

Since some majors require you to have a personal computer, you can borrow a laptop from the library ([link](https://www.lib.uci.edu/mrc/mrc-laptops-and-mobile-devices)) for 48 hours if you lose access to a computer and cannot afford to purchase one immediately. Some departments (ICS) offer two-week laptop loan periods ([link](https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/Laptop_ComputerUse)). In addition, if you are already registered with Basic Needs and receive grants and financial aid, you can contact financial aid ([link](https://www.ofas.uci.edu/)) to increase the budget for the purchase of a personal computer. In some instances, financial aid has made this option available.

&#x200B;

***Free CSO Escort Services***

The **UC Irvine Police Department** ([link](https://www.police.uci.edu)) offers the CSO Safety Escort program, a **free service to members** of the community. The objective of the program is to provide a safe alternative to walking alone at night.

&#x200B;

***Free Tax Preparation***

MyFreeTaxes ([link](https://myfreetaxes.com/)) provides ""low-income"" taxpayers with free tax preparation services. This value fluctuates annually, but the majority of students fall into this category. There are two different ways to utilize this service. You can do this online using the H&R Block software provided. Alternately, there are locations in Orange County where you can receive tax preparation assistance from an IRS Volunteer. Appointment is necessary.

&#x200B;

***Emotional Animal Support***

If you are interested in adopting a pet for emotional support, one of the legitimate places to do so is [Irvine Animal Care Center](https://www.cityofirvine.org/irvine-animal-care-center). They require a small donation when adopting a pet, but since they are affiliated with the City of Irvine, you can negotiate a reduced or waived adoption fee if you are a student. They can be reached via both email and telephone. After adopting a pet, you are required to notify your landlord and pay an additional deposit. However, if you are adopting a pet for emotional support, you can request a letter of support from the UCI Counseling Center or any psychiatrist to waive the additional deposit.

&#x200B;

***UCI Clubs***

List of UCI clubs and groups where like-minded students can be found ([link](https://campusgroups.uci.edu/club_signup?group_type=33373&category_tags=).

&#x200B;

***Other fellow students' recommendations and suggestions***

* /u/throwaway_fctg, /u/foreignfishes, /u/anthrostudentuci and /u/JWOINK  have provided good suggestion regarding financial and food emergency assistance ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/waxt4u/what_do_i_do_im_basically_broke_and_disowned/)).

I’m coming to the forum for some advice. 

I’ve been browsing a little bit on the topic of UC-SHIP / SHC and it seems to be working well for individuals who had acute medical conditions and/or accidents. I’m not sure if that’s also the case for pre-existing chronic issues. Does anyone know how the procedure might look like, and any advice on anything to watch out for during the process?

Also, I notice that SHC is generally the preferred healthcare provider (they state that they’re a primary care provider but they’re able to handle most chronic conditions) and it seems to me referrals to other providers might be subordinate to certain restrictions. I have some concerns as I don’t know to what extent the facilities and resources at the SHC would be sufficient and comprehensive enough (I am currently attending specialist clinics in my home country).

Thanks much.",1675748658,https://www.reddit.com//r/UCI/comments/10vu1un/ucship_and_preexisting_condition/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI,UCI

I’m wondering if I should take Humanities Core next year to get most of my GEs out of the way, but I’ve heard it’s really hard. I want to get my GEs of the way ASAP because I’ve wasted two quarters doing Music major classes that don’t count for GEs.

Anyone an/ Any advice for upperclassmen students who feel more lost than when they started?,"Currently I am a third year physics major, would like to potentially continue studying at the graduate level in the future, but I must admit that I am not mentally up to the task considering the trajectory I would have liked to be on versus where I am at now.

I’m having issues commuting myself fully to my studies, and have been feeling personally lost (not sure of where I would like to go, losing my sense of self). I think I need to make some personal considerations first before really trying to worry about jobs after graduating. 
If I want to end up sticking with my stem skills I think I would either a) pursuing physics or some related field of interest in graduate school or b) finding a job (which I think is more likely at the beginning) When I think of jobs that physics majors can take after graduating, software engineering, data analysis, and other engineering positions come to mind.

The story is crazy so I thought I’d share but the bigger problem is, why isn’t there better security on campus to prohibit potentially threatening people into buildings like kerckoff. I understand it’s a public campus but shouldn’t UCLA establish greater security to ensure the safety of students? Idk food for thought.

Intersection signalling improvements at Strathmore/Gayley,"You may have noticed the work being done today at Strathmore/Gayley, with manual traffic control through most of the day. Now they're finished(?), and one of the improvements that was implemented is known as a [**leading pedestrian interval**](https://ladot.lacity.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/csc-policy-guidance-lpi-revised-june-2021.pdf). 

Essentially, this intersection has two phases (Gayley through and Strathmore through), and pedestrians get their walk signals to go along with the corresponding car signal. [Leading pedestrian intervals give the walk signal *before* the corresponding through green starts](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08024/images/4_12web.png) (instead there's an all red), providing safety benefits and reducing delays to pedestrians.
Given the [very high volume of pedestrians](https://navigatela.lacity.org/dot/traffic_data/manual_counts/gayst206.pdf) at the intersection, this will help optimize for mobility of all and not just that of car drivers. 

Next time you're crossing, pay attention to the signals and notice you have around 4 seconds to walk before the green starts.",1675747248,https://www.reddit.com//r/ucla/comments/10vtm1x/intersection_signalling_improvements_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla,ucla

"Struggling with anxiety, depression, or stress? Join a UCLA study!","The Affect Treatment for Depression and Anhedonia study is designed to  examine which individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and  stress are more likely to benefit from a two different versions of  therapy. Each of these therapies include components and therapeutic  strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective for these problem  areas. One therapy focuses on enhancing and increasing positive coping  and life strategies, whereas the other therapy focuses on decreasing or  eradicating negative coping and life strategies. Both versions involve  examining thoughts, modifying behaviors, and focusing on breathing.   


Individuals  who seeking treatment for anxiety, depression, and stress, are eligible  for the study if they are between the ages of 18 to 65, are English  speaking, are not currently suffering from major medical conditions, and  are un-medicated.  Treatment is conducted one on one, over 15 therapy sessions over Zoom.  In-person assessments are conducted prior to beginning treatment, at 5  weeks, at 10 weeks, at completion of treatment, and at a 1 month follow  up. These assessments include diagnostic evaluations, a battery of  self-report questionnaires, behavioral observation, and physiological  recording in a laboratory.  


There are no fees for any of the  assessments (prior to treatment, at 5 weeks, at 10 weeks, completion of  treatment, or follow up) or treatment. Parking costs for each assessment  are reimbursed upon request. In addition, participants are offered $75  for each assessment.

LOST ORANGUTAN PLUSHIE!," 

I recently went on a school trip and went on a tour around UC Merced and lost my monkey plush. Our school and like 4 other schools were getting shown around the campus by multiple student tour guides. We went to this lecture hall or classroom (I don't know what it was) where the tour guides answered questions from everyone and we were given pamphlets of information about the college. 

After we had left the college I noticed I didn't have my little orangutan plush that I was carrying around the entire trip, so I started looking for him. He was nowhere to be found and I was devastated about it because over time, he pretty much became like an emotional support plush or just a plush I really cared about and adored (i cried about it). 

I retraced my steps and I think the last time we saw him was in that classroom where everyone got seated. I wanted to make this post to try and get people's attention to maybe help find this plushie of mine. The trip happened on 12/04/22 from like 10AM-12PM. Our tour guide was this tall Latina (like 6ft or something), and I remember she said something about her being directionally challenged. If anyone knows someone like this, please ask :(.

I live pretty far away from the college too, so I wouldn't be able to go look in places by myself and I wouldn't expect someone to like to find it and ship it back since it can be expensive. I'd just want to know if he is found or if he is safe with someone new, anything would be fine. I know this will probably not mean a lot for most people but it would mean the world to me, thank you for your time.

1. **Join a picket line!** Spend some time outside with your GSIs (1 min to however long you want!).

*Critically,* ***do not pick up any struck work*** *(e.g., grading appointments, proctoring exams, etc.) that your GSIs would normally do! We need the university to fully feel the effects of our absence!*

Food," 

The food at UCM has become edible but isn’t the best taste and there can be better. We wanted to try and come up with a solution because we have seen other UC’s get applauded for the food options they have available. We wanted to keep the dining system that the UCM chancellor created but we also wanted to improve it. We were unable to get a reply from Kurt Scheiner but our plan remains unchanged. The Pavillion on the little lake will be renovated to include popular chain restaurants. Former Pavillion food options and hours of service will be added to the YWDC which will allow students to access food whenever they want it. This creates the feeling of home and easy access the school wants while also giving students who don't like the school food options without needing to leave campus which can be difficult. A big problem is how many people don't apply to or choose UCM because of the food so if this post gets 1000 upvotes we will start a petition and go to the school chancellor directly.",1670467719,https://www.reddit.com//r/ucmerced/comments/zfmnbh/food/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced,ucmerced

"Statement by the UC Rank-and-File Strike Committee: No COLA, No Contract! For a counteroffensive against the attacks on the working class!","Sharing the statement of the recently founded UC Rank-and-File Strike Committee, which is ensuring that workers' demands are not sold out by the UAW and UC. I think it's critical for fellow students & workers to follow what the membership is saying about what they're fighting for, rather than take the UAW leadership at face value. The strike is NOT over until workers vote on a contract, and they didn't go through all this for nothing.   


Check it out, share it around & let's generate some discussion!

Here's a notable passage:   


""Our struggle is at a critical point, and the rank and file must  organize to stop a repeat of the sellout of the 2020 wildcat COLA  strike. In the past 48 hours the leadership of Local 5810 announced that  it has reached tentative agreements for 11,000 postdoc and academic  researchers. The details make clear that these agreements are sellouts,  with wage increases only marginally above what the UC initially offered  and, most importantly, no COLA provisions.

""By trying to push  through agreements for just over one-fifth of striking UC workers, the  UAW apparatus is attempting to divide us and isolate us, the better to  force us to accept contracts that do not meet our demands.

""To counter these efforts, we are founding a rank-and-file strike committee.  The task of this committee is to formulate the bottom-line demands for  any contract we will accept. It will unify all striking workers against  efforts to divide and weaken our strike and reach out to the broadest  sections of the working class for a coordinated fight.""",1669919360,https://www.reddit.com//r/ucmerced/comments/z9vgc1/statement_by_the_uc_rankandfile_strike_committee/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced,ucmerced

“These living conditions are without dignity”: University of California academic workers begin powerful strike across 10 campuses,"The *World Socialist Web Site* spoke with academic workers over the weekend at UC San Diego and UC Irvine about the conditions they face and why they will be striking.

**A third year Ph.D. international student** in the Humanities said, “The strike on Monday is very important because my family and I have been living on poverty-level wages for more than two years now. The stipend simply cannot support a family of four, especially with our visa restrictions. 

“I am barred from seeking other employment outside of my 50 percent [workload] in the university, and my partner cannot work at all. There is simply no way my takehome pay of $2,200 per month—and only with a 9-month guarantee—is enough. My rent is $1,500, utilities $150, food and groceries $400-500, not to mention school and medical needs for our kids. I am the only one in my family who has health insurance, and I pray every day none of them get sick or injured because we have no savings. I line up each week to get food from the pantry, where points allowance have been reduced. I have to beg for money from Basic Needs, just so we don’t get behind in rent. 

“I am so sick of living like this and feel that as someone who works for the university [as a teaching assistant] more than 20 hours, not to mention everything I need to do for my research, these living conditions are without dignity.

“The general mood among my colleagues is that everyone is fed up and ready to strike. We are ready to fight even if that temporarily means we lose our wages. We are still doing what we can now for our students, but come Monday, we are dropping everything to go on strike.

“Our professors, both in coursework and who we TA for, have been really supportive, canceling our classes and urging our undergraduate students to support us.

“We just want liveable wages so that we can be the best instructors/TAs and researchers. Constantly worrying about food and whether money will be enough for rent and praying to the high heavens no one in your family gets sick or injured is simply unacceptable, especially when you see your bosses and administrators living comfortably, and in the case of the chancellors, in luxury. We are demanding that UC re-appropriates funds to give us the wages we deserve—$54,000 a year which is $4,500 a month pre-tax. And increased child care funding.”

[https://www.willforuawpresident.org/](https://www.willforuawpresident.org/)

Academic workers in the United Auto Workers, across the expansive 10-campus University of California system, have voted by 98 percent for strike authorization over the past week.

A strike date has been set for the coming Monday, November 14, for 48,000 workers, including: 12,000 postdoctoral and academic researchers in Local 5810, who have been working without a contract since September 30; 19,000 tutors, readers and graduate student instructors and assistants in Local 2865, who have been kept on the job after numerous extensions were allowed since the June 30, 2020 contract expiration; and 17,000 grad students in the Student Researchers United (SRU-UAW), which was recognized in December. ...

UC workers are part of a powerful global strike wave, which includes [55,000 Ontario education support workers](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/11/08/eqqe-n08.html), who are battling the Canadian provincial Ford government. The US strike is also taking place as auto workers, university workers and other workers in the UAW are voting in presidential elections, where [Will Lehman, a socialist autoworker running for UAW president](https://www.willforuawpresident.org/), is fighting to give power to the rank and file. 

Academic workers—many of whom have families—are spending the majority of their paltry income on skyrocketing rents, and numerous UC campuses are located in the most expensive cities in California. Many are living hand to mouth, describing [horrible living conditions](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/10/27/qeuk-o27.html) that include health hazards, the inability to afford day care, food insecurity and going without meals. They are demanding an end to their precarious financial situation. 

While claiming there is no money to provide living wages for academic workers, the assets of the UC system stand at $152.3 billion as of the end of the 2021-2022 academic year, according to the UC Office of the President. The largest public institution of higher learning in the world spans the entire state of California, with 10 campuses, five medical centers, one law school, 16 health professional schools, three national laboratories and numerous satellite facilities. 

The University of California is the largest non-governmental employer in the state of California, which, if ranked as an independent country, has one of the largest economies in the world.

The reality is that the academic workers are the cheap labor workhorses that run the massive multibillion-dollar UC system. Workers are in a powerful position to win all of their demands and expand the global fight for wages and improvements. Such a victory, however, requires that workers take control of their struggle from the grips of the UAW apparatus, which has forced its membership to accept decade after decade of wage cuts and concessionary contracts. ...

I know that a lot of students have had a tough time finding internships/jobs at the moment, myself included. If you’re on the hunt for an internship or job this year, I wanted to share a free resource that has been a huge help and matched me with full time roles at companies like eBay, Anheuser Busch, and SAP to name a few!

This resource is called RippleMatch [**https://ripplematch.com/index?r=7Q38HQ**](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=7Q38HQ), it’s just for college students and completely different from job boards like LinkedIn and Indeed. On RippleMatch, you have a feed of opportunities curated just for you, kind of like TikTok. You don’t have to scroll through thousands of opportunities like you do with job boards; instead, you can generate your own matches that the AI finds for you. I love it because it takes under five minutes to apply to a match and get your profile in front of a recruiter. Another huge plus is that you’ll always hear back rather than getting ghosted by job boards.

If you're interested, you can sign-up here. [**https://ripplematch.com/index?r=7Q38HQ**](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=7Q38HQ)

It’s a quick sign up process and if you receive matches upon signing up, I’d suggest applying right away for the highest chance of landing an interview.

I’m considering leaving UC Merced - advice?,"Okay so as the title says, I want to leave UC Merced. I’m a first year CSE major, and so far I’ve had nothing but a shit experience here. I’ve had registrations hold put on me a week into class which ended up with me not getting into the classes I needed, and as it stands right now I’ve wasted a semester. And now I’m hearing that certain CSE classes that are required aren’t available year round, so if I stay I’ll be a semester behind regardless if not then longer. I had to take out over 10 k in loans just to be here this school year and I’ll have little to show for it.

So, I want to transfer. Specifically to Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. I was living in the area before I moved here, and I have family in the area. Plus Cal Poly is a better school for my major than UC Merced, with more history and most likely better connections. 

Should I just transfer to Cal Poly in the upcoming fall, or should I try to stick it out here and possibly get myself into even more debt?

Please Participate in The Boldly Forward Campaign!,"&#x200B;

tl;dr: the campus is holding a big fundraiser and we need students to be there so we can convince alumni + others to donate. 

Hey guys, 

   On October 22nd, the UC will be hosting a fundraising event in order to help Merced reach its Campaign goal of raising 100 million dollars by 2030. 

ASUCM has been tasked with putting this event together... Administration wants it to be big so that we can impress alumni/ donors of the University. They want as much student representation as possible. 

&#x200B;

I have to be honest and say that I am really dissatisfied with how administration has tasked the student body with this responsibility. ASUCM has 17 days to put this event together and it feels like there is a lot of pressure for this event to do well. To me, as well as quite a few students within the Campus Activities Board (CAB) and the Associated Students of UCM (ASUCM), this event feels exploitative. We have tried asking admin to allocate some money from the fundraising to programs/events that will directly help students currently enrolled at the university but admin is resistant to that idea. They're campaigning on the fact that this money will finally build the School of Management, fund campus expansion, and fund research labs. All great ideas, but none really directly improve the life of a current student. 

&#x200B;

  I wanted to give full transparency before asking if any of you could please show up at least for an hour on October 22nd at around 5:30 PM. At the very least we will be able to give out some free merch and volunteer hours for your resume. This is apparently a historical event for the University and there will be a decent amount of alumni + donors on campus. 

ASUCM is still trying to push for some money for clubs/organizations that show up to the event but it is not guaranteed, unfortunately. 

&#x200B;

I'm hoping that if enough students show up,  admin will see that we are an active campus and that we deserve some more funding. It's a long shot but I've already tried direct confrontation and that did not work LOL.

discover new songs on Spotify faster 🎶 [class project out],"Spotify Recs, TikTok songs, DJ sets, AUX road trips with friends and the classic, “Wow, what is that song that’s playing in the cafe right now?” Often, we can easily tell whether we like a song by listening to just a short snippet of it.

So we built a program that takes a song and shortens it to the ""best"" 10-60 seconds to help you find your next favorite song, go through your discover weekly/release radar, and add to your playlists, faster.

It creates mini discovery playlists \[each song is a custom snippets size\] based off your listening history

It'll eventually learn what the ""best"" 10 seconds snippets are to you as you listen more. Uses genre/class/valence/song/weather/chorus/bridge and other factors.

Would love criticism/feedback, thanks! :)

Don't let the hate get to you.,"Hey guys,

  I posted a video about this issue on my Instagram page (@ asucmxo) but I thought it would be a good idea to type it out here as well. 

***You go to a UC. You are getting an education. You should be proud of yourself.***

There has always been a stigma around attending Merced out of all the other UCs. A lot of people look down upon the high acceptance rate and the lack of name recognition/prestige. I know I looked down on it when I was in high school. I would actively dunk on UCM and say that I would never even think about attending this campus. ***karma...*** A lot of life happened and I ended up here. 

I hated it here at first but once I got involved I realized how Merced has the same opportunities as the other campuses, but with less competition. You can participate in research as a freshman if you wanted to. You can easily get a position in Student Government. You can easily be the founding member of a club that ends up becoming a staple in UC Merced campus life! It's amazing the resume-building, networking, and experience opportunities you have here! 

&#x200B;

You're not cool for not getting involved and you're not cool for hating the campus. You're a student here now, and I suggest making the most of your time here and taking advantage of the opportunities at your disposal. Everyone here on campus is brilliant and just as deserving of respect as students at UC Berkeley and UC Los Angeles. Don't be ashamed to be a Bobcat.

On campus jobs,"So I’ve been applying to on campus and even off campus jobs through handshake, indeed, and LinkedIn since the end of July, and I still haven’t heard back from any places I’ve applied to even after sending follow up emails about my application. The only thing I’ve gotten back was a rejection email from the cafe on campus. 
Ive been literally homeless and unemployed since the beginning of May, and I’m running out of money in my savings to pay my bills (insurances, phone bill, etc.) I’m trying really hard to get a job here in Merced at all and I’ve applied almost everywhere.

DO NOT WORK AT UPC!!,"And for those who already applied, they have not hired anyone new and if they say that, its because they don’t want to hire anyone because it means less money for the owners. Working there has got to be one of the worst jobs that I have ever worked at, and the most unprofessional managers that I have ever worked for. The coworkers that I’ve worked with are not a problem what so ever. Anyways my first “training” was literally just a text from the owner asking if I can come in for training, and when I showed up, the other workers didn’t even know that I was coming in for training. ZERO COMMUNICATION between the owners and the workers what so ever. After my “training”, I was on call for literally 2 weeks until the owner finally took the time to include me into the schedule. Speaking of schedule, it’ll take a month until the owner makes a new one, and if you wanted a job so that you can pay for rent like me, then stay AWAY FOR UPC, because you’re only scheduled TWO DAYS A WEEK!! I’ve asked for more shifts and more hours and told one of the owners that I’m here to pay for my rent, and got nothing in return! After working there for almost 3 months, I’ve concluded that the owners are basically money hungry, because why else would they not hire people, give people more shifts, and have assistant managers? Speaking of that, there are none! If you’re the longest to have been working there, then you’re technically “in charge”! Because they don’t wanna pay you more to be an actual manager! To conclude all of this, I was fired literally FOUR HOURS before my shift today and was not given a reason why 😁! All my unprofessional old boss told me was that he’ll mail me my check because he’s too afraid to tell me in person if I were to go and pick it up!

Thoughts on the Cogsci design specialization? (Asking as a potential transfer!),"Hi tritons! :-) I'm a first year at Cal Poly SLO doing a niche major called Graphic Communication and am trying to get into the major's UI/UX concentration. However, I've spoken to a lot of upperclassmen, and they say its a really lackluster program. Basically, its super new and the professors aren't very proficient, and UX side is barely touched on. The major itself is very design heavy, so I came into it knowing it'd prioritize the UI side, but its really surprising seeing how many people are disappointed in it overall.

I really don't want to leave college with a degree I find useless, and the UX side of UI/UX is what interests me the most, so I've been heavily considering trying to transfer to UCSD for its cog sci Design + Interaction specialization. To all current students in this major, I'm wondering if...

* This major prepares you well for a UX/UI design career
* Based on what you've learnt + the quality of the material, you think the switch would be worth the time + energy

Also, I've been trying to find a flowchart for the specialization + major itself as well, but can't seem to find anything online. I read a few other reddit posts from this subreddit that mention that the cog sci program is super CS + neuroscience heavy, so if anyone has any clarification on that as well that'd be great!

Lets talk about next year housing,"I am glad I can apply for next year on -campus housing as a transfer studnet who came afrer 2022 Fall. I do not have any experience of looking for rent for school days, so I am kind of relaxed about it now.

I can say I like my roommates. People are not perfect, sometimes,I do feel angry and upset with their personality , what they say and habits, but generally, we are mostly peaceful and nice. By the way, I feel like I am the role who try to connect all of us together. I often do something to let our relationship good because I just hope we can have a nice time during this school year.

When I saw the email we almost can apply for next year. Honestly, I feel excited first, then little bit sad. I feel it is a pity because all of us are from Asia and actually，more than half of us are Chinese or have Chinese background. I had expected I would live with people of different culture, so now, it should be the chance.( I even hope my roommates are gay too, but not sure is there anything I can do on the application.)

For now, maybe 3 of us will still live together, then I hope my 3 roommates of future can be from different countries( is there anything I can do?).Maybe this time, I should choose I don't mind cultural conflict. I guess I choosed the other option last time since I was little bit nervous, so I got my current roommates.

Finally, how are you guys? Any plan of housing and anything what to share?

Feeling lost as a math cs major,"So, I am currently a first year math cs major, and a former aerospace major. I impulsively swapped to math cs cause I thought it would give me a broader career outlook. But as I'm taking these classes, I'm realizing that I would have preferred to stay in aerospace because the classes and labs make it seem more interesting than math cs which has no labs or anything. And now that the aerospace major is capped, and that I've received only B's so far in the prerequisites (math 20a, 20b, chem 6a), and would have to take math 20c, phys2a and phys2b next quarter and get A's in them to even have a chance of applying for the major which seems impossible to me (unless anyone can reassure otherwise :D). So, now I'm feeling kind of lost. I don't necessarily hate math cs, but I'm just wondering will I still be able to get a good job with just a Bachelor's in this major? I've read that since it's not really a specified study, you can't exactly do much with it. And as far as fulfillment goes, what kind of jobs would you be able to get? Could you still get a job at some engineering facility? Or like same jobs as someone with an aerospace or computer engineering degree?

ALWAYS advocate for yourself,"Random but in response to a lot of posts I’ve seen this week about being disheartened by a bad midterm, grade, professor, roommate, etc.: 

The number one thing I’ve learned in my undergrad and grad here at UCSD, and I would assume applicable to every university and most life situations, is to ALWAYS advocate for yourself. 

I know it’s much easier said than done, and sometimes the outcome won’t be the favorable option, but actively proving to your professors and administration that you believe and root for yourself not only helps them understand your dedication but simultaneously convinces yourself of it as well. 

Believing that something is unjust or discouraging shouldn’t be ignored just because you may feel powerless in a situation. As Capt. Picard said “It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life.” 

When I was in Muir I was suppose to graduate at the end of Winter instead of Spring, and I checked with advising SEVEN times to make sure that was true and that I didn’t have to enroll into Spring. Just to check one more time, I asked for the eight time for them to confirm I was done when I received a message from the head of advising that I was TWO CREDITS short to graduate. Two. Somehow it was missed seven times that someone had mistyped a transfer credit and I when I believed to be done I instead had to enroll into 8 units the next quarter (in order to receive my full tuition or I would have had to pay out of pocket for those two credits). 

This year, in grad school, one of my professor’s decided to email me and a few others that we hadn’t completed a requirement that we needed to have done over the summer, but she didn’t let us know until Week 10 of Fall . . . 3 days before she needed it turned in. Instead of notifying us at any point during those 3 months she waited until basically finals week to let us know we had less than three days to have something redone and submitted. 

In both situations, I emailed and got in contact with everyone who was even potentially connected to the situation to try and salvage anything. In the first situation, there was nothing anyone could do but my gosh they made sure everything was squeaky-clean for me to graduate, and one of the courses I had taken ended up helping me a lot in grad school. 

Second situation, I emailed my program advising and an entrusted professor who brought it up to the program lead. I sent them every trace of my interaction with that professor and her inability to communicate that was a fiasco for several days over finals but . . I won! The next week, my grade had been published to “Satisfied” (basically meaning “pass”) without having to do the ridiculous amount of work she was asking for. 

What I mean is . . . ALWAYS believe in yourself. Sometimes we make mistakes and we’re wrong, but if you don’t believe and stand up for yourself things will probably not get randomly better on their own. 

You made it this far, everything is going to be ok. I promise. Seven years ago I almost took my life out of the picture, and for seven years I’ve had to try and convince myself that I deserve better than some of the shitty hands I’ve been dealt. And although I felt I was initially lying to myself, at some point over those years I started to believe it was true and I wish so badly I could go back in time and give younger u/VindictiveBitch a hug and tell her everything was going to be ok but instead I’ll tell you . . .

Note Taking Strategies,"Greetings! 

As the title indicates I'd like some input on how to best process info (in the form of notes) from lectures as a CS-Major, (so techniques that work well with really logic heavy/math related classes). Like many, I've gone into the habit of copying the slides and then going through my notes during study/hw sessions (highlighting important stuff). As I'm sure most people can agree this is very suboptimal and not really the best way to go about it, for one a lot of professors move too fast to copy the slides down, and two, it makes your notes dense and full of ""filler"" that gets in the way of effective study. I've heard an effective strategy is to ""prep"" for lectures by going through the textbook and or slide materials before the lecture and I wanted some opinions on how well that usually turns out. 

&#x200B;

I'm currently a first year and I want to optimize the way I process info, I think the hard part about college compared to HS is that everything you learn is ""high concept"" and as a result, most of what you learn simply isn't digestible on a single listen with mediocre notes (like what worked with much of high school for me). I've been trying all sorts of stuff myself and I wanted to know what works for you guys!",1675670071,https://www.reddit.com//r/UCSD/comments/10v12w8/note_taking_strategies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD,UCSD
Roommate Rant,"I’m just gonna rant here right now because I need to chill out and mark down all my thoughts before I request a roommate change. My roommate is literally the most inconsiderate person I’ve ever faced. To start, he doesn’t wash his hands after using the bathroom. BASIC HYGIENE RULE and yet he looks annoyed at ME the last couple times I brought it up and made him go wash his hands. On that note, he didn’t shower everyday during the first semester, and he STANK of BO. I asked him about it before and he just said “he didn’t feel like it.” I think he showers more often now, so maybe he caught on. Another thing is that he will literally eat everything in the dorm. I understand if it’s like snacks or something, but no it’s all his meals, like his burgers and stuff. It makes the whole room smell and I make it so obvious to open the window and check my Febreeze every time he does that, he don’t get the hint. Being a gamer, he sometimes stays up past 2 AM and talks to his friends on call, not even whispering, when me and my roommate are tryna sleep. What prompted me to snap, want to change rooms, and write this rant was what happened today. He’s been sick for 2 WEEKS STRAIGHT, coughing left and right, runny nose, the works. That made ME sick in turn, and I was so peeved about it. An hour ago from the writing of this, he was on his bed (top bunk) coughing his lungs out. All I hear and feel next is him SPITTING and the saliva/phlegm sprinkle on me (I’m sitting on my desk, below his bed). It was so goddamn nasty and it broke any semblance of hope I had for remaining in this living environment. He apologized for it, but 2 seconds later, he spit again, but this time on his PILLOW, not with great accuracy either, so my stuff underneath got infected. Other little things he’s done include (but not limited to), clipping his toenails on his bed and letting them fall underneath onto MY bed, putting his grassy, musty shoes out in the open right between my desk and his, and most ANNOYINGLY of all, having redundant alarms that he just snoozes for an hour straight, while I’m there tryna sleep at 8 am. I swear I’m a really laid back dude, but this is just too much for me. 

TLDR; gross roommate, I cri, I hope to get new roommate or move to a diff dorm. Thank you for listening to my TED rant.",1675590466,https://www.reddit.com//r/UCSD/comments/10u8wzg/roommate_rant/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD,UCSD

Multilingual interlocutory solicitation,"Greetings, fellow students. As midterms and the halfway point of the quarter are approaching, I have, according to custom, become bored out of my mind. This is usually the point where I make a feeble attempt to attract people off the internet who have some sort of common interest with me. I like learning foreign languages and believe that at this point this is the most likely of my pastimes to be suitable as an impetus for interpersonal communication. Here is a list of languages in which I may enjoy a conversational partner to help me learn/improve (as well as literally converse):

Japanese, Spanish, Russian, Arabic (better at MSA but maybe can stumble through a dialect idk), German, Italian, French, Latin, Esperanto, Mandarin Chinese

If you are a speaker of one of those and interested in humoring a strange internet hermit, please message me privately.

Who is the working class in Goleta and Santa Barbara?,"Email readmarxsb@gmail.com to get involved in our rapidly growing reading and discussion group!

Why the Working Class? by Vivek Chibber, 2016

https://jacobin.com/2016/03/working-class-capitalism-socialists-strike-power

&

Where to Begin? by Vladimir Lenin, 1901

https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/may/04.htm


Suggested questions to keep in mind for the Chibber reading:
-What makes workers within capitalism so important when it comes to making social change, especially regarding economic justice?
-Why does Chibber argue that for any significant societal change to occur, it must rely on the ""mobilization of working people""?
-Who in Santa Barbara are ""working people"" and who are not? 

Suggested questions for the Lenin reading:
-What historical circumstances might have led Lenin to write about the need for strategic uses of 'terror' to overthrow the Russian monarchy? 
-Why was Lenin critiquing other socialists of the time for their ""we must take up arms"" talk, and argued instead that what socialists in Russia really needed was... a newspaper?",1675404441,https://www.reddit.com//r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/10scxlw/who_is_the_working_class_in_goleta_and_santa/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara,UCSantaBarbara

Save My Grade: a new website to see past grade distributions and professor statistics for UCSB,"Hi! I’ve been working on this project over the last year and am very excited to finally release it.

[https://savemygrade.pythonanywhere.com](https://savemygrade.pythonanywhere.com)

TLDR:
Save My Grade is a website similar to Grade Tier in that you can see grade distributions and statistics for past courses by selecting quarters, department, course, and professors, with even more features.

Additional features:
- Includes all data from Fall 2009 through Spring 2022
- Compare professors that have taught the same course by viewing data such as average grade or Rate My Professor rating (with quick links to their RMP page)
- Search by a professor to see all past courses they’ve taught, and view how their statistics for each course have changed over time
- More features to come in the future, including easily viewable enrollment history, course descriptions and prereq information, and course suggestions

Save My Grade’s purpose is to be a central hub for all course information that is easily accessible for UCSB students. I will continue to work on this project so it can even further achieve this goal.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions!

I think I’m finally figuring stuff out,"I just wanted to make this post to share how amazing things have gotten recently for me. I really feel like I made some great decisions with where I wanted to take my education and I really love the classes I have been taking. 

Back in the pandemic I was living on campus in my first year and it was for sure the worst year of my life. I was deeply depressed, suicidal, and beyond terrified of any sort of social contact. I failed at least half my classes and I was on track to be kicked out. Fortunately, through a lot of self reflection and hard work I was able to make a recovery both mentally and academically.

Now I’m in my third year exploring stem classes and getting straight A’s. I’ve started volunteering, working a part time job, and I’m looking into possibly working for a research lab.

Campus finally has an Overleaf subscription,"After about 10 years of requests, UCSC finally has a campus subscription to Overleaf, the online system that provides Google-docs-like access to LaTeX:

>**Overleaf Pro now available at no cost to campus community**  
OR, BE, and PBSci are jointly covering the costs of Overleaf Pro for LaTeX, which **includes real time track changes**. The [UCSC Overleaf Commons subscription page](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/ucsantacruz) is live, and SSO login and subscription enrollment are active. Existing users with a UCSC email can log in through SSO, and cancel any paid personal subscription.

Some courses have used Overleaf for years, relying on the free plans that allow single users and referrals that allow increases in the number of people who can share a document. Having that sharing available without needing the clumsy referral workaround is great! (The free service also did not include track changes, if I remember correctly.)",1675787177,https://www.reddit.com//r/UCSC/comments/10w60o8/campus_finally_has_an_overleaf_subscription/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC,UCSC

Hazardous UCSC traffic,"Does a loved one attend UC Santa Cruz? Contact them about possibly being 1) a potential victim of traffic or 2) a dangerous driver.

Kresge,Working on the new dorms and academic building has been a blessing to me. I’ve been asked a lot of questions by some of you who are just curious about the process and what to expect. I truly hope you all appreciate the hard work we put in and hope you enjoy all of it when it’s finished.

Slug Crossing AGAIN?,"Does anyone know why the campus is still doing slug crossing? I thought this was a temporary approach to commencement during COVID, but I think it lowers the cost for them so they continue to do it?

Its frustrating because you can only invite a few people and it takes the excitement away with the loss of all the speeches, professors being present, and the crowd. Berkeley and so many other UC campuses have gone back to regular commencement so it just seems really unfair. I think normally your entire college does commencement all at once. If anyone has thoughts on this or knows any more about it, please comment!!

I think those graduating this year deserve a real commencement and this is something seniors should be angry about, especially if the school is doing it for convenience and to save money.",1675374758,https://www.reddit.com//r/UCSC/comments/10s21t7/slug_crossing_again/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC,UCSC

Anyone experiencing REALLY slow ResWifi speeds??,"For context, I regularly play online games, stream movies & shows, attend online classes, etc, but mostly the game experience is affected for me. I live in the crown/merrill apartments.  


Ever since my roommates and I moved back in from winter break our wifi speed has been ATROCIOUS. I used to pull an average of 300mb download speed but now I get like 30-40mb. All the games I play are barely enjoyable and super laggy, and I have an average of 120 ping, peaking up to 500+ frequently.  


I'm having someone come check out our router next week but I wanted to see if anyone else has been experiencing bad network since the start of this quarter.

How Does the Dorm/Roommate Situation Work?,"I'm a HS senior seriously considering attending UCSC, and since they emailed me saying decisions start to arrive in late February, I figured I'd ask my question here on Reddit sooner rather than later.

How does the roommate/dorm situation work? I know that if you don't find somebody to dorm with, someone is chosen for you, but what happens specifically if you do find someone after you're admitted (ex: on Instagram) to dorm with - how do you ensure you're placed together, and go about selecting housing with them? Or are you supposed to wait till you're placed in a residential college, then find a roommate, and then inform the college from there?
